# Gex-Remastered
A mod for Oblivion Remastered that adds a Gex follower to the game.

This mod only works in Oblivion Remastered version 1.1, it will crash if you use version 1.0. Make sure you are updated.

YOU NEED TesSyncMapInjector installed for this to work. Get TesSyncMapInjector here:

TesSyncMapInjector needs UE4SS to work. Get UE4SS here:

Copy the OblivionRemastered folder over your OblivionRemastered folder. If you have the game on Steam then it's probably here:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Oblivion Remastered\OblivionRemastered

You're copying over the one without the space in the name.

Don't forget to add gex.esp to your Plugins.txt. If you have the game on Steam then it's probably here:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Oblivion Remastered\OblivionRemastered\Content\Dev\ObvData\Data\Plugins.txt

I have my gex.esp after Knights.esp and before the Altar ones, but I don't know if that matters.

Gex is at The Merchants Inn in the Imperial City's Market District.
